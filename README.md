# bgse_supervisors
Quick and Dirty R Code to scrape a list of all bgse students and their supervisors from the BGSE website. 

This is just based on HTML nodes and quite simple. There are 5-6 supervisors that need to be added manually because addressing these exceptions explicitly in the code would not be worth the effort.
